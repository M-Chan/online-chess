a**3 and 3.5 are caused by the same error

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Pieces to be captured shrink into the circle - need to fix this bug

3.5) You can only click on the circle to move the piece - should be anywhere inside the square

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Castle method for the king needs to be completed - using the threatened attribute of each square

5) Right now the king can just move anywhere, further refinement needed here (can't move into check basically)

6) Can't move a piece if it exposed the king to a check (pinned pieces)

Alek: working on the React side of this project as well as the socket.io thingies

TingTing: fix the CSS bugs and learn a bit of socket.io and do the last rules part

Sai: React and Socket.io


CSS fadein effect - works when moving to an empty square but not when capturing -- OPTIONAL

small bug with en-passant capture - can only do it when the opponent's piece moves two up - straight away



need to made the circles a bit better - they're really large and ugly right now



check, checkmate, stalement - left to do
