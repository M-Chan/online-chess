a**3 and 3.5 are caused by the same error
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Pieces to be captured shrink into the circle - need to fix this bug

3.5) You can only click on the circle to move the piece - should be anywhere inside the square
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Castle method for the king needs to be completed - using the threatened attribute of each square

5) Right now the king can just move anywhere, further refinement needed here (can't move into check basically)

6) Can't move a piece if it exposed the king to a check (pinned pieces)
