Making a chess game using JS

Using Vanilla JS but later transferring it over to React.

* Making the game so you can play locally 
    * moving the pieces according to the rules of chess
    * implementing the special rules such as castling and en passant


TO-DO
* Also can play with another person over the internet (using node.js and socket.<area>io)
* Chess AI? might do this in the future
